        <h1>Xmla4js - OLAP for web applications</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to your xmla4js homepage!
        </p>
        <p>
            Xmla4js is a standalone cross-browser javascript library that provides basic XML/A capabilities, allowing webdevelopers to access data and metadata from OLAP provides for use in rich web applications.        
            XML for Analysis (XML/A) is the defacto standard protocol to communicate with OLAP servers. It defines a SOAP webservice that allows clients to obtain metadata and to execute MDX (multi-dimensional expressions)  queries using HTTP as the underlying transport protocol.

                <a href="samples/discover-synchronous.html">discover-synchronous.html</a> - Illustrates how to use Xmla.js to do synchronous retrieval of OLAP metadata.
                The sample lets you enter a URL for a XML/A webservice, and then allows you to explore what datasources it provides, what catalogs and cubes it contains, 
                and how these are organized, all the way down to the members and their properties.
